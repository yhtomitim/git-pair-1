###Our Git Workflow (Nick Munson and Tim Hurley)

I am going to give Nick access to the app repo that I copied from the drill repo.

Then Nick is going to clone down the repo of the moved app folder, and create a branch on his local computer

Then Tim is going to create a branch on his local computer

Then we will take turns using the random task generator on our own branches of this repo.

When we finish the task, we will create a pull request to the master branch, and then we will merge the request into master.
